# Connect4RogueLike
This is a repo for a Connect4 - Roguelike game. It's my attempt at making something simple into something thats more like me, as I really love roguelike games.

In the example theres one special piece which destroys others around it.
The whole gameplay loop would be getting more cards with different effects and fighting against more difficult enemies.
And still, the goal of the game is to connect 4.

# Controls
- Player: Click to drop your piece
- AI: Automatically makes a move after your turn

# Future Plans
- Roguelike "map" to be beaten with an ever changing deck
- Unlockable special pieces
- Powerups or hazards on the board
